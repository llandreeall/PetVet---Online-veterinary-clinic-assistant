I apologize in advance for the english speakers, but this project is made in romanian. PetVet is an online veterinary clinic assistant which can help the clinic staff keep track of the patients and the inventory. <br>
This is the final project for the course "Databases" that took place in the first semester of the third year in college. I made this project using PHP, a little HTML and CSS. <br>
The main point of this project was to showcase our knowledge about MySQL, databases and CRUD operations. 
Here are some screenshots: <br>
This is the main page, when a user comes for the first time this is what he sees:<br>

This is the login page. If a user is an admin the visual interface will change and also an admin will have no restrictions when updating the data:<br>

On the right we have a button that takes the user to his Account page. Here you can see that a user can update his personal information and can also log out:<br>

In the middle we have a button that takes the user to the Inventory page. Here he can do the following things:<br>
-There are 3 buttons at the top: one that leads to all the medicines/drugs available, one that leads to the previous page and one that leads to all the medical interventions available;<br>
-Next a user can add an intervention to his personal information, one that he knows how to perform. Not every user knows the same intervenTions, maybe one is a master in vaccines and the other in neutering interventions;<br>
-Next we can search a user/medic by CNP and verify that he knows how to do all the interventions available. This can be helpful in case of an emergency;<br>
-Next we can see all the interventions that the user can do and side by side is a list of other users/doctors that can do the same interventions; This can be helpful to find replacements for other doctors in a time of need;
Right know with this user I haven't added any interventions, but below is an example with a user that has interventions. <br>

-Next a user can search a pacient and see how much he has to pay;<br>
-Next a user can search all the pets that a pet owner has;<br>
-Next a user can click on a button that provides all the drugs/medicines that are running low in units;<br>
-Next a user can click on a button that provides all the pets/pacients without an owner. Sometimes stray pets are treated here, then are put up for adoption;<br>
-Next there is a table with all the pacients that need help as soon as possible, these cases are emergencies;<br>
